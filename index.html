    <h1>Shop Around for Medication? You should

    <p><a class=firstLetter>W</a>hile you look for the best price on a car, scour over the internet for the best deal on appliances and shop around for electronics, you may want to consider doing this for prescription drugs. </p>
    <p>In 2016, I turned 26 and found myself without insurance for the first time. I went to Rite Aid to pick up my birth control and found it would cost me over a $100. I was not going to shell out $100 for a prescription drug I had been paying $10 for
      in the past. A few phone calls and price quote later, I had my prescription sent to Costco pharmacy.</p>



    <h2>“The chains are big and they have economies of scale but they rip you off” said Geoffrey Joyce, pharmacoeconomist.</h2>

    <h3>Let’s see how much prices can differ:</h3>

    <p><a class=firstLetter>I </a> researched the top three prescription drugs for birth control, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes and asthma. Then I called and looked up the prices of these drugs at three different sized retail pharmacies
      in Rego Park, NY. I chose a regional chain pharmacy (Duane Reade), a national wholesale discount pharmacy (Costco) and a local independent pharmacy (Value Pharmacy Inc).

    <h3>Why is there such a huge price different?</h3>
    <p><a class=firstLetter>P</a>rescription drugs prices in the United States are not regulated by the government. With this free market, the price of a prescription drug can differ up to hundreds of dollars at different pharmacies.</p>

    <p>Retail pharmacies have benefit managers that negotiate with pharmaceutical companies or drug wholesalers to get a discount. According to the <a href="https://www.pcmanet.org/">Pharmaceutical Care Management Association</a>, 80 percent of the 3.2 billion
      prescriptions dispensed in American have been negotiated by pharmacy benefit managers. Big chain pharmacies can also get a discount on prescription drugs because they buy in bulk. However, a pharmacy does not have to pass on the savings to their
      consumers. They can sell a drug at a higher price to make a bigger profit.</p>

    <p>According to <a href="http://healthpolicy.usc.edu/ListItem.aspx?ID=6">Geoffrey Joyce</a>, chair of the pharmaceutical and health economics department at the University of Southern California’s School of Pharmacy, “the chains are big and they have
      economies of scale but they rip you off.” </p>
    <p> Joyce has been collecting data of drug prices in Los Angeles. His students went to over 500 pharmacies to get price quotes for their prescriptions. They learned the biggest price range occurs with generic drugs. According to Joyce, brand-name drugs
      cost around the same price, however, generic drugs are less expensive and more likely to get higher price mark ups. “The pharmacy all else constantly makes more money per script on a generic than they do a brand” said Joyce.</p>

    <h3>Who does this affect the most?</h3>

    <p><a class=firstLetter>M</a>ost people are not affected by these price differences. If you have health insurance, you’re usually just responsible for the co-pay. However, the price difference becomes an issue if you don’t have insurance or if your insurance
      doesn’t cover the drug that you need. Joyce has also seen an increasing number of people who have high deductible insurances. These people have to pay for medication out of pocket until they reach their deductible.</p>
    <p>As an insider, Lindsay Brown knows the importance of shopping around for prescription drugs. She has been a pharmacy technician for almost 10 years and currently works at Barry Latham Drug’s in Guntersville, Alabama. She likes how simple this calculator
      is. “Looks great," said Brown “with just a few clicks you get the prices right there at your fingertips.”
